# MainHub

This project was developed within the scope of the course 
Software Testing and Quality Control to put into practice 
the Quality Assurance, Test-Driven Development and CI/CD 
strategies learned in the practical classes.

## Project Abstract

Nowadays, pick-up points services are closely related to the main-stream and 
well-known courier services, serving as sub-systems. 
However, this fact limits potential partnerships with small 
stores and shops that are on efficient locations for pick-ups 
but are not seen as relevant to the big courier services. 
We are committed to develop a flexible solution that allows 
physical stores to approach us and make pick-up deals as well 
as allow online stores to solicit our services. 
This way we are thriving to achieve an efficient network 
of pick-ups that bring the purchased products closer and 
faster to the end users.

We developed an application named DropMate whose goal is 
to manage a network of associated collection points (ACP) 
and parcel lockers and provide a withdrawal B2B service to 
e-Stores.

The full-stack application DropMate consists of a REST API 
and a web application to be used by internal administrators 
and associated collection points operators. 
In addition, we developed an e-Store web instance of an 
online flower shop called Floral Fiesta as a proof-of-concept 
demonstrator of the full-stack application.
